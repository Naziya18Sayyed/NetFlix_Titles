**Problem Statement:**
Netflix's vast content library makes it challenging to understand trends and distribution, so this project uses Tableau to visualize and analyze the Netflix dataset from Kaggle, uncovering insights to inform content strategy and user engagement.

**Objective:**
The project aims to create an interactive Tableau dashboard using Netflix data from Kaggle, providing in-depth analysis of content distribution over time, geographic distribution, and genre popularity.

**Approach:**
I. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Import the Netflix dataset from Kaggle into Tableau.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

II. Creating Visualizations:

- Develop various charts and graphs to represent the data, including:
- Line charts to show content addition trends over time.
- World maps to display the geographic distribution of content.
- Bar charts to highlight the most popular genres.
- Plots to analyze content attributes such as ratings and duration.

**Chart Description:**
1. Area Chart of Total Movies & TV Shows by Year:
This area chart shows the growth of Netflix's content library over time, from 2008 to 2019. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis represents the cumulative count of titles added each year. It uses two color gradients to distinguish between movies (darker shade) and TV shows (lighter shade).

2. Map of Total Movies & TV Shows by Country:
This map displays the geographic distribution of Netflix's content library. Each country is shaded according to the number of movies and TV shows available, with darker shades representing higher counts. This visualization highlights content availability across different regions.

3. Bar Chart of Ratings:
This bar chart shows the distribution of Netflix titles by their ratings. The x-axis represents the different ratings (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14, TV-PG), while the y-axis shows the count of titles under each rating. The chart indicates the most common ratings for Netflix content, with TV-MA and TV-14 being the most frequent.

4. Bubble Chart of Movies & TV Shows Distribution:
This bubble chart represents the proportion of movies versus TV shows in the Netflix library. The larger bubble indicates that movies make up 68.42% (4,265 titles) of the content, while the smaller bubble shows that TV shows comprise 31.58% (1,969 titles). The size of the bubbles visually emphasizes the dominance of movies in Netflix's catalog.

III. Interactive Dashboard:
- Combined all these visualizations into an interactive Tableau dashboard.
- Included filters and parameters to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

IV. Insights and Recommendations:
- Analyzed the visualizations to uncover key insights.
- Provided actionable recommendations based on the findings, such as potential areas for - 
  content expansion and strategies for enhancing user engagement.
